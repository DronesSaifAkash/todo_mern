To run a MERN stack project with a `client` folder for the frontend, follow these steps:

 1. Set Up Backend:
   - Navigate to the Backend Directory:
     
     cd path/to/your/todo_mern
     
   - Install Backend Dependencies:
     
     npm install
     
   - Start the Backend Server:
     
     npm start
     
   Ensure that your backend server is running and is typically available on a port like `http://localhost:5000` (or another port specified in your configuration).

 2. Set Up Frontend:
   - Navigate to the `client` Directory:
     
     cd client
     
   - Install Frontend Dependencies:
     
     npm install
     
   - Start the Frontend Development Server:
     
     npm start
     
   The frontend server should now be running and accessible, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

 3. Check Environment Variables:
   - Ensure that your frontend and backend have the correct environment variables configured, such as API endpoints. Often, these are set in `.env` files or environment-specific configuration files.

 4. Verify Connections:
   - Confirm that the frontend can successfully connect to the backend API. This might involve checking API endpoints, CORS settings, and network connectivity.

 5. Optional: Build Frontend for Production:
   If you need to build the frontend for production:
   - Build the Frontend:
     
     npm run build
     
   - This creates a `build` directory with static assets that you can serve with your backend or deploy separately.
